Yet   another   clone     of    the  Antigrain     Geometry    library
(http://www.antigrain.com/)    created  by  Maxim     Shemanarev.  The
hi-quality  graphics library without  any central maintainer (?). This
clone is based on https://agg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agg.

It us menat to serve as the  backend for my  poppler-agg prohect to be
found under:

 https://github.com/oncaphillis/poppler-agg.git

Changes for now

 * made some operators for agg::trans_affine const
 * added agg_color_cmyka and agg_pixfmt_cmyk
